## ⚠️ COMMON QUESTIONS

### **Q: But my app is about health/first aid. Shouldn't I select Health Info?**
**A:** NO. "Health Info" in Data Safety means **user's personal health data**, not health-related content.

### **Q: Won't removing this hurt my app's discoverability?**
**A:** NO. You can still:
- Select "Medical" or "Health & Fitness" as app category
- Use health/first aid keywords in description
- Show health content in screenshots

### **Q: What if Google rejects my app for not declaring health content?**
**A:** They won't. You're correctly stating you DON'T collect user health data. Your app provides educational content, which is different.

---

## 📞 IF YOU'RE STILL UNSURE

### **Ask yourself:**
1. "Does my app ask users to enter their symptoms?" → NO
2. "Does my app track user's fitness/health metrics?" → NO
3. "Does my app store user's medical records?" → NO
4. "Does my app collect any personal health information?" → NO

**If all answers are NO, then DON'T select "Health Info"!**

### **What your app actually collects:**
- ✅ Email (for login)
- ✅ Name (optional, for profile)
- ✅ Location (for emergency numbers)
- ✅ Voice (for AI assistant)
- ❌ NOT user health data
