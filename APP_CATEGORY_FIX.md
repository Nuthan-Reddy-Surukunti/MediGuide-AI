# App Category Fix - Play Console Rejection

## Problem
Your app was rejected because:
- App category: **Medical** (requires organization account)
- You're using: **Individual developer account**

## Solution: Change to Health & Fitness Category

### Steps in Play Console:

1. **Go to Play Console** → Your App (MediGuide AI)

2. **Navigate to**: Store settings → App category

3. **Change Settings**:
   - **App or game**: App
   - **Category**: **Health & fitness** (NOT Medical)
   - **Tags**: Emergency, First Aid, Health Guide

4. **Update Health Features** (App content → Health):
   - Select: **Medical** → **Emergency and first aid** ✅
   - Deselect any "Medical device" or "Clinical decision support" options
   - Keep it focused on: Educational first aid guide

5. **Content Rating**:
   - Your app provides: Emergency information and first aid instructions
   - No medical diagnosis
   - No clinical treatment recommendations
   - Educational purpose only

### Why This Works:

✅ **Health & Fitness** category is for:
- Fitness tracking apps
- Health information apps
- **Emergency and first aid guides** ← Your app
- Wellness apps

❌ **Medical** category requires organization for:
- Medical diagnosis apps
- Clinical decision support systems
- Prescription management
- Medical device control apps

### Your App Description Should Emphasize:

**MediGuide AI** is an:
- **Educational first aid guide**
- **Emergency response reference tool**
- **Health information resource**

NOT a:
- Medical diagnosis tool
- Clinical decision support system
- Medical treatment provider

### Additional Recommendations:

1. **Add Disclaimer** in app description:
   ```
   "This app provides educational first aid information only. 
   It is not a substitute for professional medical advice, 
   diagnosis, or treatment. Always seek the advice of your 
   physician or other qualified health provider with any 
   questions you may have regarding a medical condition. 
   In case of emergency, call your local emergency services."
   ```

2. **Update App Description**:
   - Emphasize: "Educational guide"
   - Emphasize: "Reference tool"
   - Avoid: "Medical diagnosis", "Treatment", "Clinical"

3. **Privacy Policy** (you already have this ✅):
   - https://nuthan-reddy-surukunti.github.io/mediguide-privacy-policy/

### After Making Changes:

1. Save all changes in Play Console
2. Submit app for review again
3. The app should be approved within 1-7 days
