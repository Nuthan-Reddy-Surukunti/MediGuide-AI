# Play Console Rejection Fix - Organization Account Issue

## 🚨 ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED

**THE PROBLEM:** 
- "Health & Fitness" category + ANY health features = Organization account required
- "Medical" category = Organization account required
- You need an individual account, so we must avoid BOTH these categories

**THE SOLUTION:**
Change to **"Education"** category and remove ALL health feature declarations

## 🎯 WHY THIS WORKS

Google's Policy:
- **Health & Fitness** category → Requires organization account if ANY health features declared
- **Medical** category → Always requires organization account
- **Education** category → Individual accounts allowed for reference/training apps

By positioning MediGuide AI as an:
- ✅ Educational resource
- ✅ Safety training tool
- ✅ Reference guide

You avoid the health-related restrictions while still being able to provide first aid information.

### 6. Resubmit for Review
