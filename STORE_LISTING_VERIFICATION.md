## 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUES TO FIX**

### 1️⃣ **REMOVE "Health and Fitness" Category**

**Why:** You provide educational health content, but you don't collect user health data.

**How to Fix:**
1. Click **"Back"** or navigate to **Step 3 - Data Types**
2. Find **"Health and Fitness > Health info"**
3. **UNCHECK** this box
4. Click **"Next"** to go back to Step 4
5. Verify "Health and Fitness" no longer appears in the preview

**Result:** This section will disappear from your store listing:
```
❌ Health and fitness
   Health info
   Data shared: App functionality
```

---

### 2️⃣ **REVIEW "Developer Communications" (Optional)**

You listed **"Developer communications"** as a purpose for collecting email addresses.

**Question:** Do you send push notifications or emails to users about:
- New features?
- Important updates?
- Security alerts?
- App news?

**If YES:** Keep "Developer communications" ✅
**If NO:** Go back and remove this purpose ⚠️

Most apps DO use this for account-related emails (password reset, verification), so it's probably fine to keep.

## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT REMINDERS**

### **DON'T:**
- ❌ Don't select "Advertising or marketing" anywhere (you have no ads)
- ❌ Don't keep "Health Info" selected (you don't collect user health data)
- ❌ Don't proceed to Step 5 until Health Info is removed

### **DO:**
- ✅ Remove "Health and Fitness" category completely
- ✅ Verify Store Listing Preview shows 12 data types (not 13)
- ✅ Ensure all purposes are accurate
- ✅ Make sure "Optional" is marked where users can choose

---

## 📞 **IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS**

### **"Should I keep Developer Communications for Email?"**
**Answer:** YES, if you:
- Send password reset emails
- Send email verification
- Send account-related notifications
- Plan to inform users of critical updates

**NO, if you:**
- Never send any emails to users
- Only use email for login (no communications)

Most apps keep this. It's standard.

---

### **"Why remove Health Info if I provide health content?"**
**Answer:** The Data Safety section is about **USER DATA YOU COLLECT**, not content you provide.

- ❌ **Wrong:** "We share health info" (sounds like you share user medical records)
- ✅ **Correct:** "We provide educational first aid content" (in app description)

Google Play's data safety is about **user privacy**, not app features.

---

### **"Will removing Health Info hurt my app's visibility?"**
**Answer:** NO! You can (and should) mention health/first aid content in:
- ✅ App description
- ✅ Short description
- ✅ App category (Medical or Health & Fitness category)
- ✅ Keywords/tags

The Data Safety section is ONLY about data collection, not app features.
