## Answers for Play Store Console

### **Downloaded App Content**
**Question:** Does the app contain any ratings-relevant content (e.g., sex, violence, language) downloaded as part of the app package (code, assets)?

**Answer:** ✅ **No**

**Reason:** Your app contains medical/first aid information only - no sex, violence, or offensive language.

---

### **User Content Sharing**
**Question:** Does the app natively allow users to interact or exchange content with other users through voice communication, text, or sharing images or audio?

**Answer:** ✅ **No**

**Reason:** Your app does NOT have:
- User-to-user messaging

Users interact with the AI assistant only, not with other users.

### **Online Content**
**Question:** Does the app feature or promote content that isn't part of the initial app download, but can be accessed from the app?

**Answer:** ✅ **Yes**

**Reason:** Your app:
- Uses Google Gemini AI to generate responses (AI-generated content not in app package)

- This is similar to Netflix showing movies or news apps showing articles

**What content type:** AI-generated health guidance and emergency assistance

---

### **Promotion or Sale of Age-Restricted Products**
**Question:** Does the app focus on promoting or selling items or activities that are typically age-restricted such as cigarettes, alcohol, firearms, or gambling?

### **Miscellaneous Questions:**

#### 1. Share Physical Location with Other Users?
**Answer:** ✅ **No**

**Reason:** While you use GPS to detect the user's state, you DO NOT:
- Share location with other users

**Answer:** ✅ **No**

**Reason:** Your app is completely free with no in-app purchases.

---

#### 3. Cash Rewards, Gift Cards, NFTs, Cryptocurrency?
**Answer:** ✅ **No**

## 💡 IMPORTANT NOTES

### About "Online Content - Yes"
Selecting "Yes" is CORRECT because:
- Your AI assistant generates content in real-time
- This is considered "online content not in the app package"
- Similar to how ChatGPT, news apps work
- Google needs to know the app connects to external AI services

### About "Educational - Yes"
This helps your app:
- Get better visibility in educational categories
- Be recommended to users looking for health education
- Potentially avoid certain policy restrictions
- Accurately represent your app's purpose

---

## 🚨 COMMON MISTAKE TO AVOID

**DON'T select:**
- ❌ "User sharing - Yes" (you don't have user-to-user features)
- ❌ "Share location with users - Yes" (location is internal only)

These would require additional privacy/safety measures.
